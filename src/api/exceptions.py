"""Custom exception hierarchy for the LCP gateway.

Every exception carries:
  - ``code``        — stable machine-readable error code (``LCP-XXXX``)
  - ``status_code`` — HTTP status code to return to the client
  - ``details``     — optional sanitized detail payload

The code space is grouped by category:
  1xxx — client authentication / authorization
  2xxx — upstream provider errors
  3xxx — chain / circuit breaker failures
  4xxx — client request errors (policy, invalid body, config)
  5xxx — internal gateway errors
