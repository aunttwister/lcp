"""Memory plugin — backend contract.

LCP's memory layer exposes a unified, per-profile semantic memory bank to any
client that talks to the gateway. The backend is pluggable: the protocol below
is the only contract the HTTP layer depends on, which keeps tests independent
of the embedding model and the vector store.

The real backend (``LanceDBMemoryBackend``) is installed via the Setup page as
a module, exactly like LiveBench — it is NOT part of the core dependencies, so
the gateway stays lean when memory is not used.
