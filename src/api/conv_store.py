"""LCP's own conversation message store.

LCP keys a conversation by the client's ``x-opencode-session`` header, which the
``lcp`` model-provider plugin makes every Hermes agent send (its own session id).
This module owns the *messages* of those conversations, so LCP is self-sufficient:
it no longer has to reach into another application's session database to answer
"what was said in this conversation".

Two writers feed one table:

* the one-off migration (``scripts/migrate_conversations.py``) imports the corpus
  that predates this store, with ``origin='migration'``;
* the live capture appends the messages of each request as it is served, with
  ``origin='capture'``.

Both go through :func:`append_messages`, which is **positional and idempotent**:
it compares the incoming sequence against what is stored and appends only the
suffix that is not already there. Re-running the migration therefore adds nothing
the second time, and the next request of a live conversation adds only its new
turns — no duplicated transcripts.

Content is capped at :data:`MESSAGE_CAP` per message. ``content_len`` always
records the true length and ``truncated`` flags the row, so a capped row stays
self-describing and the audit view can report the real size instead of silently
showing a shortened body.
